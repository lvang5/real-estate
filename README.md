# Real Estate Listing
I created a MEAN stack application that allows a user to have 3 different view home, rental, and sale. Within the views are images of properties that are available. This list will be updated consistently as a user adds additional homes. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions/comments.

## Built with these technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- SQL
- EXPRESS
- ANGULAR JS
- NODE.JS

## Install on local host
1. Download project
2. In terminal/command prompt type:
    * npm install
    * npm start
3. Open web browser and type in localhost:5001, press enter
